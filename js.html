    <li>Template Literals - They are strings put in backticks <strong>`name ${varName)`</strong></li>
    <li>Number data type incluedes all numbers including 3,3.4 -3 etc.</li>
    <li>Difference between === and == is that === don't changes the variable type before comparing but == implicitly
      changes type
      and then compares the value.<br>
      So 5 === "5" will be false but<br>
      5 == "5" will be true.</li>
    <li>** is a exponent sign. So 5 ** 2 means 5 square.</li>
    <li>Procedural programming means writing code without a function (blocks) and write them step-by-step - like a
      procedure.</li>
    <li>We should avoid using global var as they can be used and changed by anything.</li>
    <li>Object can have other objets as well as functions.</li>
