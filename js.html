  <ul class="event-delegation">
    <li>Template Literals - They are strings put in backticks <strong>`name ${varName)`</strong></li>
    <li>Number data type incluedes all numbers including 3,3.4 -3 etc.</li>
    <li>Difference between === and == is that === don't changes the variable type before comparing but == implicitly
      changes type
      and then compares the value.<br>
      So 5 === "5" will be false but<br>
      5 == "5" will be true.</li>
    <li>** is a exponent sign. So 5 ** 2 means 5 square.</li>
    <li>Procedural programming means writing code without a function (blocks) and write them step-by-step - like a
      procedure.</li>
    <li>We should avoid using global var as they can be used and changed by anything.</li>
    <hr>
    <li>Object can have other objets as well as functions.</li>
    <li>In basic terms - <strong>Context (this)</strong> is used to access variables inside an object. This refers to
      the parent component. So in the <code>main.js</code> this refers to obj object.</li>
    <li>
      The context of this changes based on where a function is called from. See eg on <code>main.js</code>. So it is
      determined from where the function is being called from.
    </li>
    <li>Object don't have order but arrays do.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        "a string".length - Here length is a property of the string. While defining string or other data types JS
        provides some important properties and methods for them.
      </li>
      <li>"a string".toUpperCase() - toUpperCase() is a method of the string.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>.join() function without an argument will join an array. If we put an argument inside join then it will join as
      well as put that argument in-between each element of the array.</li>
    <li>
      Method technically means a function in an object.
    </li>
    <li>.document and DOM are the same things. HTML structures the DOM and JS can use this DOM to make further
      modification and functionality.</li>
    <li>A function should only perform a single task.</li>
    <li>const A_NAME is a programming convention of naming variables that should never be changed.</li>
