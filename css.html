  <ul class="css-list specifity">
    <li class="css-list-list">
      In CSS the rule which is defined in the last is applied to the html. If they have the same specificity.
    </li>
    <li class="css-list-list">
      Specificity refers to the priority given to the rule. So if a rule have multiple selector (.class-a.classb) or
      specific selector which means defining the ruleset with a class or ID will have higher specifity than calling the
      tag directly.
    </li>
    <li class="css-list-list">
      IDs have more specificity than multiple classes and !important have the highest specificity. <strong>We should
        always avoid IDs and !important in CSS because its add more complexity to the code. Instead of giving it more
        specificity, we should use class to directly access it from a single location.</strong>
    </li>
    <li class="css-list-list">One usecase of using !important is to override the ruleset of a library. But in this case also we can put our
      css file after the library file in head tag.</li>
    <li class="css-list-list">
      A pseudo-class is a special class that determines the state of the element it is attached to. Eg :hover :active
      etc
    </li>
    <li class="css-list-list">We can use :first-child :last-child to select that particular child.</li>
    <li>* universal selector</li>
  </ul>
  <button class="pseudo-hover">Hover</button>
